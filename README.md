# Palatium Desiderii Game Project

## Boss Fight against the embodiment of Your Desires

A years old idea I never worked on.
The player comes face to face with the towering figure that is their greed and desire for riches. It wishes to punish you: no second chances. You only want reform: change is always possible. Who has to fall and who takes it all?
This project is being made and worked on now as an aid to my creative block and low motivation.

## Goals (Work In Progress)

I started this project quite suddenly with little thought, so I have few goals as of now:

* Produce a functional game
* Discover ways to improve my code in readability and efficiency
* Widen my knowledge regarding Github
* Aid creativity and reignite motivation
